# bb-fork

This is a thin, auditable deployment overlay for [get-bb/bb](https://github.com/get-bb/bb). It does not carry a second copy of upstream source and it does not treat a long-lived Git branch as the release definition.

The current base is the exact source commit tagged `desktop-v0.39.0` at `b33abbff098ac4c857578e7350d492dcaa65d489`, matching the deployed `bb-app@0.39.0` npm release. Release tags are preferred over a moving or lagging default branch.

The deployable source is exactly:

1. the commit in `upstream.lock`, also pinned by the `upstream/` submodule;
2. the ordered mail patches in `patches/series`;
3. the resulting Git tree in `result-tree.lock`.

Materialize a disposable checkout with:

```sh
git submodule update --init
./scripts/verify
./scripts/materialize
./scripts/check-p6r-namespace build/bb "$(cat upstream.lock)"
cd build/bb
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

`scripts/materialize` refuses to overwrite an existing checkout. The materialized tree is disposable; make durable changes as patches in this repository instead.

Run `./scripts/delta-report` to see the complete downstream footprint. See [DOWNSTREAM.md](DOWNSTREAM.md) for patch intent and compatibility boundaries.

## Updating upstream

1. Advance the submodule to a reviewed upstream commit and copy its full SHA to `upstream.lock`.
2. Replay the logical downstream commits in a temporary bb worktree, resolving against current behavior rather than preserving obsolete component locations.
3. Regenerate DB migrations, bundled SDK declarations, and templates using upstream's generators.
4. Export the reviewed commits with `git format-patch --full-index --binary`, replace `patches/series`, and refresh `patches/sha256`.
5. Materialize with `--committer-date-is-author-date`, then record `git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}` in `result-tree.lock`.
6. Run `./scripts/verify` and the full CI suite before tagging this overlay repository.

The patches are deliberately organized by product capability and receipt boundary, not by the chronology of the original experimental branch. Implementation-only workflow files are excluded.
